Good idea. I'll do some [research] to see which organizations accept [donations] of furniture. I'm sure there are [several] in the area."

Well, we like to keep our [readers] in the know, so we have a long list of questions for you. I'll start. What does the city plan to do with this tax [revenue], Ms. Haddad? The money will be used to add [bicycle] lanes citywide, which I'm excited about. Bicycle lanes should reduce [traffic] and promote health. Some business owners are [concerned] about losing street parking. Are you worried about that?"
