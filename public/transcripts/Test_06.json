Hopefully, we'll raise enough [money] at that event to replace the old [lighting system], too."

Our [lease] expires next month, so we should look at a different space. There's a new [office building] on Second Street. It has [solar panels], so all of its energy comes from [renewable] sources. I like that. But I'm worried we may not be able to [afford] the lease. We'll see. I'll contact the [rental agency] today."
