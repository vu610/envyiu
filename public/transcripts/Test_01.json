The [food] was great, by the way, especially the peach [pie] you a made. Would you mind sharing the [recipe]? It was delicious. I found the recipe [online]. I'll send you a [link] to the webpage. There's a really helpful [video] that walks you through all the steps. I recommend you [watch] it first. All right, thanks."

I'm almost done, but I have a question about a [hotel receipt] from one of our employees. What's the [problem]? Well, our [policy] is for employees to stay at a hotel that's on our list of [approved accommodations]. This one isn't on the list. Who [submitted] the receipt? Moritz Ziegler, one of our [sales representatives]. Hmm, he's a [new employee] and may have forgotten the policy. As a [supervisor], I can [approve] the expense this one time."

By the way, your [parking area] is nearly full. Where can I tell my clients to [park]? Our customers can park for [free] in the [garage] across the street.

Any thoughts on what we should be [concentrating] on going forward? The biggest [trend] right now is the reduction of [sugar]. The public wants [healthier] products, but the same great taste. That'll be our biggest [challenge]. One of our [ingredient suppliers] recently started offering a [sweetener] made entirely from [natural ingredients]. Are there [similar] ones on the market? And how do they [compare]? I'd have to do some [investigation] to find out more about that. I have some [time available] tomorrow afternoon."

I remember that, but there were a lot of [details] to work out, like whether our [offices] would stay in [Chicago]. Now it looks like we won't be [relocating].

The first thing to do is to [invest] in a few special [tools], like a [trowel] and [crowbar]. It's important to choose some that are [high quality], because you'll use them for many years. With your trowel and some [roof cement], you can [seal] any [cracks] or chips. The crowbar will help you [remove] loose [shingles] that you can then [replace]. Now, I highly recommend you take [photos] of your roof every year so that you can [track] its overall [condition]."
