I worked at the main [reception desk] at the Southeast Regional [Hospital] for a while, but I'd like to try a [different role]. You'd be [responsible] for moving patients to various [locations] throughout the hospital. It'll involve about [six miles] of walking every shift. Are you okay with that?

He said a strong [advertising campaign] makes a difference and [referred us] to you. He's right. You need to [advertise your store] before it opens. Have you looked at the [information] we sent? Yes. And here's what I think. First, you should [emphasize] the fact that this will be a [family-run business]. [Local customers] will appreciate that."
