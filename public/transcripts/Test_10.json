Great, but this year, I'd also like us to [donate] our top-of-the-line bicycle to the [winner] of the race to show how much we care about our [community]. That's a nice idea, but [sponsoring] the race is already going to be [costly]. I'm worried about the added [expense] of donating a bicycle as well."
